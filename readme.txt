This is a basic script to install TLauncher on Linux

First make sure you have installed python3 and python3-pip, if you haven't then you will have to run "sudo apt install python3 python3-pip"

Remember When you run the install command it will request your sudo password because it needs to copy the main file to /bin which requires sudo(sometimes you don't have too).
To run the install script just type 'installer' when you're in the directory and then type in your sudo password(sometimes you don't have too), you can check the script if you don't trust it.
 
When you've installed it,then you can run 'tlauncher' in the terminal to launch tlauncher and if it doesn't find it then it will download it which requires your sudo password possibly if you haven't installed java.

The TLauncher files will be located at "/home/yourname/Documents/TLauncher" and the script will be located at /bin/tlauncher
